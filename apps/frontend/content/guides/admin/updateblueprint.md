This guide only goes through updating Blueprint. If you'd like to update Blueprint and Pterodactyl together, refer to [Update Pterodactyl](/guides/admin/updatepanel).

## Updating Blueprint to the latest release

Run `blueprint -upgrade` to update Blueprint to the latest stable release. This will print a few warnings, don't worry though, your extension settings won't be lost.

```bash
# Updates Blueprint to the latest release
blueprint -upgrade
```

## Updating Blueprint to the latest commit

Living on the edge? The following command will update Blueprint to the latest GitHub commit.

::card
Latest commit is for development purposes only. No support will be provided and things **will break**.
::

```bash
# Updates Blueprint to the latest commit, uses the
# blueprintframework/framework repository by default
blueprint -upgrade remote

# Optionally, manually define the blueprintframework/framework
# repository and update that way
blueprint -upgrade remote blueprintframework/framework
```

## Updating to the latest commit of a fork

Using a framework fork? You can switch to it by using the `remote` argument on `blueprint -upgrade`. At this time, Blueprint expects a GitHub repository name as argument.

```bash
# Updates to a custom Blueprint fork, you can add any GitHub
# repository as argument. If your GitHub repository is not a
# Blueprint fork, bad things might happen
blueprint -upgrade remote organization/repository
```
